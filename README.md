# Where's My Tutor
This application is designed to increase the productivity and help the time management of the students and staff at Nottingham Trent University. This will be achieved by streamlining the processes needed for students to communicate with their lecturers face to face. The time taken to set up meetings between students and lecturers could be reduced by a significant proportion, should the entire student and staff body use this system.

The app is catered to two distinct user groups, namely students and staff, offering lecturers the capability to broadcast their location through GPS or manually set it using Google Maps for students within the app. Additionally, the app enables users to schedule and monitor meetings, specifying details such as timeframes and locations. It features a notification system that alerts recipients upon receiving a meeting request.
